# Probability_In_Robotic_Design_Handbook
Probability is the fundamental of the Robotic movement. As humans, we solve these probabilities in a variety of ways. 

## Introduction
### Uncertainty in Robotics
Using the word certain the way we'll use it in this handbook, nothing in the previous question is ever certain:

1. What other traffic will do: People are impossible to predict with certainty!
2. Where you are: It may seem like you know where you are when you drive, but you don't. At least not with complete certainty. You may know where you are with sufficient certainty, but if I asked you how many millimeters away from the center lane you were, you wouldn't know.
3. How fast you're going: The same reasoning applies to knowing your speed. You can get a good idea of how fast you're going by looking at your speedometer (which measures your speed), but these measurements are never perfect.
4. What will happen when you turn the wheel: A car is an imperfect mechanical system. If you turned the steering wheel by the same amount 100 times, the car would turn a slightly different amount every time.
As humans, we solve these problems in a variety of ways, but in this handbook, we will solve them using Python (programming languages), and probability(math)
